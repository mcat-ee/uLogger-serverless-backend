# uLogger-serverless-backend

This is a serverless backend for receiving location data from the uLogger app - it is very much a work in progress.

## Notes

* Tracks are currently not supported. (Tracks are a uLogger mechanism for sorting data points).
* There is no user authentication.
* The data is not currently saved, that will be refactored into it's own handler.
